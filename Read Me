Hello !!!!!, 

How its works?????

- you must install Python 3
- Install Atom or any text editor (Not necessary )
- Install telethon using cmd  command: pip3 install telethon\
-Get your Api and Hash id from www.my.telegram.org/auth
-add detials to scrapper.py and adder.py
-Run scrapper.py and scrap group members.
-Run adder.py and add scrapped members to your group


Basically it scrapes member from group where the logined id is admin and it creates a .csv file.
And the adder reads .csv file and add member to the target group.
